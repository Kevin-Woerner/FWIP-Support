Programs implementing the FWIP meta-language

I got tired of writing a useful function in one language, discovering it
   would be useful in another language, porting it over, discovering some bug
   / glitch in said function, fixing it in one place and not the other, and
   then wonder why it wasn't working the code I didn't fix.

So I wrote a 'meta-language', FWIP with a very simplistic syntax, that I
   could write my useful functions in, and then have the computer spew out
   code for various languages (currently Supported languages: Python, Perl,
   GNU BC, Visual Basic 6, and VB.Net)

Typical usage:
   fwippreprocess Kw.fwip |
      fwip.tab |
      fwipformaty |
      fwiptranslator -nKw --py > Kw.py
